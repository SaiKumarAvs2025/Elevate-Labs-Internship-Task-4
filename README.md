Firewall Traffic Overview : 

A firewall is a security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules.

Inbound Traffic
Definition: Traffic coming into your network from external sources (e.g., the internet).
Purpose: To protect internal systems from unauthorized access, malware, or attacks.
Examples:
A user accessing your website.
An external email reaching your mail server.
Firewall Action: Typically blocked by default unless explicitly allowed (e.g., web server on port 80/443).

Outbound Traffic
Definition: Traffic going out from your network to external destinations.
Purpose: To allow internal users and systems to access external resources.
Examples:
Browsing a website.
Sending emails or updating software.
Firewall Action: Often allowed by default, but can be restricted to prevent data leaks or malicious connections.
